=================================== Description ====================================== 

This plugin allows authors to show progress of their current writing projects within a widget in their sidebar. 
Visitors to their blog based author platform can see progress of writing which builds anticipation prior to publication. 
Keeping fans informed of progress also helps to build trust and can help to motivate the author to meet daily word targets.

=================================== Installation =====================================

Upload the Author Progress Bar plugin to your Wordpress site and activate it.

=============================== Capabilities management ==============================
If you want to give to Authors access to the widget, you will have to install the 'Capability Manager' plugin ( http://wordpress.org/plugins/capsman/ ).
This is because the widget can be access by default by users having administrator rights.
Once activated change the settings on the 'Capabilities' page under the 'Users' menu.
Select the 'Author' role to edit and tick 'Edit theme options' before saving.
The 'Author' user type now can add/edit 'Widgets' and 'Menus' under the 'Appearance' menu.
They can also view the current theme, but cannot change or edit it.
